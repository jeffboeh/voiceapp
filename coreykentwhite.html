      <p class="bio">Oklahoma born and bred singer and songwriter Corey Kent White mixes classic country influences with contemporary pop melodies and production. White grew up in Bixby, Oklahoma and began singing at the age of three, inspired by his favorite artist, Garth Brooks. He began playing guitar at age 8, and made his first appearance on-stage when he was 11 at the Oklahoma State Fair in Tulsa. While the audience for his show was small, one patron liked what he heard and introduced him to Oklahoma Stomp, a group of young musicians playing classic Western Swing. White became Oklahoma Stomp's vocalist, working with the group for five years, and he began considering a career in music. White graduated from high school when he was only 16, and he soon moved to Nashville in hopes of making his way into the music business. In time, White returned to his home state to attend Oklahoma State University, but he kept writing songs in between classes and put together a band to play local clubs. White developed a strong regional following and before long, he was dividing his time between Oklahoma, where he and his band had regular bookings, and Nashville, where he hoped to get a record deal. In 2014, White released an independent three-song EP titled Making Noise, and in 2015, he was selected to appear on Season 8 of the television talent competition The Voice. White became part of Blake Shelton's team, and made it into the Top 10 before it was whittled down to the Top 8. While White didn't win, appearing on The Voice introduced him to a larger, wider audience, and he and his band spent plenty of time on the road, playing for White's new fans. In May 2016, White released another independent EP, a five-song effort titled Long Way.</p>
